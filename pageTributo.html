				<div class="widget_texto">Today, Taiwanese citizens choose their leader every four years through direct election. If it were not for the actions of Lee Teng-hui when he was in office, this might not be the case. As president, Lee pushed to end the state of martial law and reinstate elections for leaders of the Republic of China. It is because of these courageous decisions that I think of Lee as the true father of Taiwanese democracy.</div>

					After leaving office in 2000, Lee went on to support the pan-green coalition led by the DPP, and oppose candidates in favor of Chinese unification from his former party. For these reasons, I consider Lee a true patriot of Taiwan, and one of the most important figures in its history.
